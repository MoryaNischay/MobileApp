# ExpensesManager

First Flutter project.

## Getting Started
## 7 Dart files have been used 1 for each page and 1 for theme
## Shared preferences is used to store data locally in secondpage.dart
## The Main page has 2 buttons to select clients I am going to further develop this so one of them is not yet enabled
## Choosing client brings us to a page where we can select if we want to add an entry of spent money or lent money
## After choosing Spent we come to a screen where we enter our amount and chose 1 of the 3 departments this value is then stored locally
## We can see the amount we have spent by clicking the view stats button on the same page
## Similar for the Lent page but we only have 1 option there to add to total amount lent
