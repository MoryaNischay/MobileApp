# ExpensesManager

First Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Login is integrated with my firebase project.

Firebase is being used as the backend for this project.

Going to add google and fingerprint sign in soon.

The Variable storage is gonna be updated soon to fix the issue with lent money being the same as money of groceries. 

Look out for more themes to be added in the future!!


## Run
Install the dart extension in open the main.dart file. 

Type flutter run to run the app on Windows/Edge or any other Virtual Mobile Device you have setup!
